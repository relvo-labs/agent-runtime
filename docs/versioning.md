# Versioning

The npm package version and wire version answer different questions.

- Package versions describe the TypeScript/JavaScript API and artifact. All packages begin pre-1.0 and use Changesets to record version intent. Additive and breaking public changes both require a minor bump; breaking notes begin with `BREAKING:`.
- `WIRE_VERSION` describes serialized commands, receipts, events, snapshots, capabilities, workspace DTOs, and generated JSON Schema identities. Pre-1.0 wire compatibility is exact by minor line. Package patches or minors may retain the same wire version.

No publish workflow exists. Version files and pending Changesets provide evidence and release intent only; publication requires a separate reviewed decision.
